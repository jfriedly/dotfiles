About
=====

This repo will host my config files for things like vim, bash, ssh, and such.
It's on GitHub so that I can easily keep track fo what I did before and get these files onto new machines that I use.

If you'd like to use it yourself, clone the repo and run setup.sh.
That will automatically move in my id_rsa.pub and my authorized_keys, so you'll want to wipe those.
